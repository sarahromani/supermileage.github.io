title: Unveiling Event 2016

This past thursday our team hosted their annual unveiling event where we reach out to the community for support in hopes of winning free shipping of our vehicles to competition through one of the Shell mini challenges. The day started out gray and rainy but luckily the sun came out soon enough. We had a great time talking to everybody about what the team is all about and by the end of the day we had collected over 2000 signatures, even Catherine McKenna Minister of the Environment and Climate change came by ad showed her support! We're still waiting on the results of the competition but a big thank you to everyone who stopped byt to say hello!
